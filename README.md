# Clustering_Enron


## Team:
- Tim Strauven
- Kivanc Gunduz
- Anjali Tiwari

## Description:

Analize the Enron email dataset, this is a set of :
- 500 000 messages
- 150 users, mostly senior management of Enron
- Organized into mailbox folders
- 2.5 GB uncompressed
- link: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/
---
## Deliverables:

 Facilitate the exploration of the dataset by:
-  Organising it by topic (clustering, topic modeling)
- Without being overwhelming (small number of clusters)
- Remaining as relevant as possible
- In practice, the clustering may need to be hierarchical:
- Start fuzzy and specify more and more
- Build a tool as user friendly and demonstrable as possible:
- (deployed) web interface > command line > notebook (still good though)
- 10 minutes demo / per team on Friday @ 14.00
- Everybody will present

## Project Roadmap (Backlog):

- [X] Download data
- [X] Create Github Repo
- [X] First look at data
- [ ] Add literature research in fraud business to provide a different perspective or an additional analysis of the current project. This can help identify gaps in the current knowledge and highlight future directions. 
- [ ] Data cleaning from half of million emails. 
- [ ] Data preprocessing 
- [ ] Decide on what algorithm to use: Kmeans or LDA (topic modeling) look like good candidates
- [ ] user interface

## Daily sprint items:

#### - Monday
