# Clustering_Enron


## Team:
- Tim Strauven
- Kivanc Gunduz
- Anjali Tiwari
- Rosyidah Nadia

## Description:

Analize the Enron email dataset, this is a set of :
- 500 000 messages
- 150 users, mostly senior management of Enron
- Organized into mailbox folders
- 2.5 GB uncompressed
- link: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/
---
## Deliverables:

 Facilitate the exploration of the dataset by:
-  Organising it by topic (clustering, topic modeling)
- Without being overwhelming (small number of clusters)
- Remaining as relevant as possible
- In practice, the clustering may need to be hierarchical:
- Start fuzzy and specify more and more
- Build a tool as user friendly and demonstrable as possible:
- (deployed) web interface > command line > notebook (still good though)
- 10 minutes demo / per team on Friday @ 14.00
- Everybody will present

## Project Roadmap (Backlog):

- [X] Download data
- [X] Create Github Repo
- [X] First look at data
- [ ] Add literature research in fraud business to provide a different perspective or an additional analysis of the current project. This can help identify gaps in the current knowledge and highlight future directions. 
- [ ] Data cleaning from half of million emails. 
- [ ] Data preprocessing 
- [ ] Decide on what algorithm to use: Kmeans or LDA (topic modeling) look like good candidates
- [ ] user interface

## Daily sprint items:

### 1. Monday
   ***General***
   - [X] Download data
   - [X] Create Github Repo
   - [X] First look at data
   - [X] Brainstorm for ideas and approach at12h05
   
   ***Jobdesk***
   - [X] Tim : Creating dataset in CSV 
   - [X] Kivanc : Analysing K-means Clustering and vectorization
   - [X] Anjali : Exploring Enron Case and the structure of Topic Modelling 
   - [X] Nadia : Research in Clustering and Topic Modelling
   
   ***Challenge for today***
   - Which clustering method to use? --answer : topic modelling and K- means.
   - What is the expectancy of the end result? --answer :  data visualization of topic modelling and K-means.
   
### 2. Tuesday
   ***General***
   - [X] Brainstorming at 09.00 and 12.00
   - [X] Data cleaning
   - [X] Literature review in Clustering method
   
   ***Jobdesk***
   - [X] Tim : Literature review and applying Clustering method in csv file
   - [X] Kivanc : Literature review and applying Clustering method in csv file
   - [X] Anjali : Providing a clear stepstone to reach the goal and data cleaning, topic modelling (preprocessing, model application and evaluation)
   - [X] Nadia : Data Cleaning and visualization
   - [X] In the afternoon all member is working on data visualization based on Kmeans and LDA models. 
   
   ***Challenge for today***
   - Tim : To create a first cluster, using Kmeans and plotting and to understand clustering process. 
   - Kivanc : To implemente time and understanding clustering.
   - Anjali: Overall understand all steps of preprocessing for topic modelling but facing some issue in  visualizing  model (showing some error).
   - Nadia : Data visualization in LDA is empty, might caused by the data process.
   
   ***Next day goal **
     taking out insights from that (improvement in data processing if reauired) and compare insgihts of both models (how it is making sense)  and done with modelling part and start user interface (if possible) 
   - [X] Tim : taking out insights from that (improvement in data processing if reauired) .......
   - [X] Kivanc : taking out insights from that (improvement in data processing if reauired) .....
   - [X] Anjali : solving visualization issue, taking out insights from that (improvement in data processing if reauired), find optimal no. of topics 
   - [X] Nadia : taking out insights from that (improvement in data processing if reauired) ...... 
   
### 3. Wednesday
